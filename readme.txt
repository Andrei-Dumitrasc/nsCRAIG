They include an implementation of the proposed solver nsCRAIG as well as of other solvers used for comparisons: FOM and GMRES.
Two test problems generated with IFISS
    http://www.cs.umd.edu/~elman/ifiss3.6/index.html
are also provided.

See 2310.06952.pdf for more details about the algorithms and test cases.
